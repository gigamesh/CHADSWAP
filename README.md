# CHADSWAP

**A token-gated dashboard of pump analytics**

The dashboard will display aggregated data from crypto influencer accounts (twitter, youtube, etc): mentions of tickers, # of likes & retweets, rate of change, etc. The social media data will be algorithmically compared to price feeds to identify when coins are most likely on the verge of a pump. 
## CHAD tokenomics

To access the dashboard, the user's wallet must be holding 5 CHAD (initially fixed, but potentially adjustable based on a vote by CHAD holders)

- **1000** total CHAD supply
- **100** Dev/founder portion
- **900** distributed via a bonding curve
## Possible features:
- Text alerts
- ability for any CHADSWAP member to add tokens to the dashboard
