# CHADSWAP

**A token-gated dashboard of pump analytics**

The dashboard will display aggregated data from crypto influencer accounts (twitter, youtube, etc): mentions of tickers, # of likes & retweets, rate of change, etc. The social media data will be algorithmically compared to price feeds to identify when coins are most likely on the verge of a pump. 
## CHAD tokenomics

To access the dashboard, the user's wallet must be holding 1 CHAD at token launch. This number will linearly increase at the rate of 0.5 per month (e.g., at the beginning of the 3rd month, 2 CHAD tokens will be required). 

### Distribution

CHAD will be sold for USDC via a quadratic bonding curve, such that the 10th CHAD will cost $0.04, the 100th CHAD will cost $4, the 1,000th will cost $400, and so on (curve design [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/5kiawsgenk)).

This will enable free price discovery as the demand grows, but the quadratic price increase throttles speculation and user growth (ie: protect's the early CHAD buyers' alpha ðŸ˜Ž ).

300 CHAD will be reserved for founder/dev funds
